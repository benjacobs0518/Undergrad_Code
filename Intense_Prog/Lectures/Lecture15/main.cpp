int main() {
  // Part 1 (factory)
  // ---------------
  // 4) get pointers to one of each type of your Emotion objects via your EmotionFactory. Then,
  // call the Emotion's get_count method to see how many Emotion objects have been instantiated.
  Emotion * e1 = EmotionFactory::GetHappy();
  Emotion * e2 = EmotionFactory::GetAngry();
  //Emotion * e3 = EmotionFactory::GetSad();

  std::cout<<"Number of emotions created: "<<std::endl;

  std::cout<<"------------------------------"<<std::endl;
  // 5) are your EmotionFactory's Get____() methods static or non-static? Do you think that they should
  // be one or the other? Justify your answer. If your methods are static, what would change if they were
  // non-static? If they are non-static, what would change if they were static?


  // 6) Feel free to create more creatures here
  Creature original_creature(14);

  // 7) Infect your creatures with your emotions. Test out the Creature Spread method.

  // STOP! Turn in Emotion.h, Emotion.cpp, and main.cpp on canvas

    // Part 2 (prototype)
    // ---------------
    // 3) Create some new Creature * objects by using the Creature's Clone() method. Does this method use dynamic dispatch?
    // Answer:
    // How did you test this?

    Creature *c1 = original_creature.Clone();


    Creature *c2 = h->Clone();



    // If you finish:
    // -------------
    // 4) Write a new function in this file void ScienceLab(Creature * original) (not associated with any classes)
    // that takes an original creature and conducts experiments by cloning it and measuring the spread of emotion.
    // You have complete creative freedom here. Feel free to add methods to the Emotion/Creature classes.
    // (The only requirements are the function definition and that you must call Clone() within that function).
    //
    // Call your ScienceLab function as many times as is necessary for your experiments.
